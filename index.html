								<h3>IR Distance Sensor Prototype</h3>
								<p>This is a custom built IR distance sensor. This was designed and built by myself for a small maze solving robot and needed to be as accurate as possible within the tight corridors. To test the prototype it was connected to a dsPIC30F4011, so that the output could be displayed on the terminal. Doing this also allowed for the code to be written to gather the sensor data for the mapping alorithm for the robot.</p>

								<h3>Pressure Sensor with LED Indicator</h3>
								<p>This was a project for university where the amount of pressure applied to the strain guage was used to visually displayed. The sensitivity of the guage could be controlled using a potentiometer. </p>

								<h3>Distance sensor PCB</h3>
								<p>This sensor was designed to fit a micrmouse-style robot for a module at university. It was my job to design and build the IR sensors for this project. The IR transmitters and recievers were designed so they could be removed for easy storage and transport, they were removed for this photo but would be connected to the pins on the board.</p>

								<a href="images/fulls/soundSens.gif" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/soundSens.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Sound Activated Sensor</h3>
								<p>This is a portotype for a sound activating sensor. This idea is that the microphone would trigger the circuit at the sound of a human voice from around 2 meters away. Once the circuit was activated, it would stay active for a length of time, this could be changed through the switch on the righthand side and could be changed between 2 seconds (for testing), 30 seconds, and 1 miniute.</p>

								<h3>Simple Navigation Robot</h3>
								<p>For this project the robot pictured would have to navigate through a winding corridor, once it reached the end of the corridor the robot would have to locate a box outside the corridor, the robot would then score points depending on how close the robot could stop next to the box without touching it.</p>

								<h3>More Projects will be added soon</h3>
								<p>As a full time student, university is my priority. I will be updating this with my work soon.</p>
